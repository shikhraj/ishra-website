    <p><strong>Hey Plaksha!</strong><br>
    I’m <strong>Ishrat Bombaywala</strong>, and I’m seeking your vote for the position of <strong>Academic Secretary</strong>.
    I’m a sophomore BSE student deeply determined to make the student experience at Plaksha better — and that starts with our academics.
    Let’s jump right in to why you’ll want me as your representative.</p>

    <h2>Why I’m Running</h2>
    <p>Because I believe academics at Plaksha should feel like growth, not survival. I want to strengthen the bridge between students and faculty, streamline communication, and create systems that actually make our lives easier — not more confusing.</p>
    <p>Let’s be honest: half of our stress comes not just from the workload, but from poorly planned academic calendars, miscommunication, unclear updates, or last-minute chaos. <strong>We can fix that.</strong></p>

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>A Plaksha where we all have room to breathe, and access to systems that are built to last. A campus where we feel heard and prepared.</p>
    <p><strong>Here’s what I plan to bring to the table:</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Well thought-out Academic Calendars</strong> — So all batches get a dedicated midsemester week, <em>before</em> major holidays!</li>
      <li><strong>Alumni Mentorship Program</strong> — Connect 1st and 2nd year students with seniors and alumni that match your interests for real academic and career guidance. Think seniors with internships and PPOs from BCG, McKinsey, EY, Arcesium; admits to Harvard and CMU. Their insights are valuable, and I’d love for them to have a chance to speak — and for us to hear. Let’s build a culture that lifts each other up, not a rat race.</li>
      <li><strong>Course-Specific Bootcamps</strong> — Quick, collaborative sessions led by Professors, TFs, and peers to help everyone catch up and keep up. No one left behind.</li>
      <li><strong>Resources</strong> — Recorded lectures, slides, PYQs, lab help, and guidance to explore beyond the syllabus. Access matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear Communication</strong> — Minimize confusion and build strong Instructor–Instructor and Instructor–Student bridges. Create systems that last so everyone’s on the same page.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To add to all of that, I am one of you. No fancy 9.5+ GPA (unfortunately) keeping me glued to my books day in and day out. You don’t want someone acing the current system; you need someone struggling right by your side. I’ve dabbled in every aspect of Plaksha academics — doing my best in class, working on research projects, publishing, and yes, surviving sleepless nights on four cups of coffee.</p>

    <p><strong>I promise to represent every voice</strong> — the achievers, the ambitious, and the ones just trying to make it through. A vote for me equals a vote for academic advocacy.</p>

    <p>Signing off,<br><br>
    <em>Your next Acad Sec,</em><br>
    <strong>Ishrat Bombaywala</strong></p>
